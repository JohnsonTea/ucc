Latest SOW scope discussion
1.       Jabber is softphone. With each phone license we received a Jabber license, so there is a softphone for every hard phone we purchased. 
  a.       The 5 Jabber endpoints stated in Page 6, refers to CDI showing ISE how to set up five softphones. The assumption is that after we see five implemented we will be able to do this on our own.
2.       There is a  reason SIP is not addressed in the SOW.  I have been told by CDI that in putting this initial design together (the design the BOM was based on) Joe felt that trying to put SIP in place on top of everything else would be difficult at best.  Therefore, the original intent in this SOW implementation was to build out the network with PRI’s. 
  a.       There is a certain sanity in the decision in that ISE will not do too many things at once. We have SIP capabilities, but according to the plan this would be undertaken as a separate project. (We’ve already bought the SIP hardware)
  b.      We can still do SIP as part of this project (an include a PRI). But we can only have one primary: either PRI or SIP
 
3.       The QoS will be from a cookie cutter but we get to add the frosting. Yes, the QoS is a standard Cisco one, but it will be addressed within the Design Phase.  CDI will work with us in putting the right fitting specs and how to test, but if there are any ISE requested variations, changes from the QoS that CDI does not necessarily approve of, CDI has reserved the right to not get involved. 
  a.       CDI specifically stated they are not getting into WAN configurations.
 
4.       CDI considers Firewall design a separate project out of scope from this one.  Inbound/outbound internet access and LAN/WAN security access to Firewall is wholly ISE’s responsibility, unless a separate SOW is requested for the work.
  a.       Karl did verbally promise to do a License Review of our Cisco security licenses as a good faith side project.
 
5.       There was confusion about the need to provide ISE staff more than 5 phones in the System Acceptance Testing section on page 15.  
  a.       The intent here was for everyday users of the phone, not, for example, MOPS, so CDI thought a phone on Victor, Momin, Lou, and James’ desks would be all that we want to test.
 
6.       I need clarification regarding Call Reporting as discussed in yesterday’s meeting.  There are two different types of Call Reporting in this system: a robust version, with charts and graphs, that is a part of the ten Call Agent licenses, and simple reports that can be generated for the general population.
  a.       Reporting” was left in the SOW, but we should explain what it is we are looking to pull.
 
7.       The 7am to 7pm window is what CDI believes will be needed.  If they are needed outside of that time, we will address it when the time comes, but it is not something they will change in their contract.
  a.       Based on their history with us, this shouldn’t be a problem.
